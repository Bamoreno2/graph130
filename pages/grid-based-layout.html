        <h3>Losing <div>Bokhu/ Translated by Jack Saebyok Jung</div></h3>
        <p>Even if no one can feel you anymore, you must
    say that you are a wind, that you are
    a breath, that you are
    recovery. To darkness,
    say. Say that you need darkness.

    If a bird keeps flying into you. If the
    bird keeps saying, I am
    wind, please hold me and take me with you. If it asks
    to give yourself.</p>

        <h3>Of the Art of Cobweb Painting <div>Alba Cid/ Translated by Jacob Roger</div></h3>
        <p>only a hundred of these postcard-size canvases remain.
    a miracle or a lesson. such is memory.

    the moon continues its free fall, like the apple,
    and a half-beaten sun goes on
    shining through the colorless regions of the paintings,
    so that the figures
    float
    against an opalescent background.</p>

        <h3>Migrant Life<div>Paloma Chen/ Translated by Julia Conner</div></h3>
        <p>we are wasting our life in a land

    of filth, life, impure life, mixed life,
    hybrid life, polluted life, rich life,

    filtered life, aching life, extinguished life,
    life alight, life in ecstasy, motionless life,

    rooted down life, sacred life, migrant life,
    wounded life, migrant life, wounded life,

    open life, closed life
    migrant life</p>
